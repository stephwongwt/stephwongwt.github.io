description: Finally added a domain name, and revived the blog after 8 years.

I finally added a domain name for this page! I actually bought the domain name 2 years ago, updated it on GitHub halfway, and promptly forgot about it. Finally the domain expired, and I have now finally bought it again, and set it up proper. Also adding a second post, plus updating the first post to be more accurate.

I've also finally completed the set up, following this guide on [dev.to](https://dev.to/aleksandrhovhannisyan/creating-a-personal-website-with-jekyll-and-github-pages-a-comprehensive-guide-3fje#getting-started-with-jekyll).

~~Next on to setting up HTTPS.~~ Since I'm already on Github Pages, I already have HTTPS!

I intend to slowly go through the things I have done on github, adding some comments or thoughts about what I did. And I will also be adding new things that I have been doing, or new things I have learnt.
