Well, I finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - it's powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It is actually a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

This was done following [Jonathan Mcglone's guide](https://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) to creating a personal page on GitHub using GitHub Pages and Jekyll.
