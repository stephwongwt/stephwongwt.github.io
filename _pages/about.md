I like learning new stuff, and exploring new tech and gadgets. So I became a jack of all trades and a master of none.

##### I originally started off as a multimedia developer

Kicking off with [ActionScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript), [Adobe Creative Suite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Creative_Suite), [Autodesk Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/sg/products/maya/overview) and [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). Ah, the **_Flash_** of nostalgia. Together with PHP and HTML+CSS+JS.

##### Then I did a [mid-career switch](https://www.digipen.edu.sg/showcase/news/from-web-administrator-to-embedded-software-engineer) and learnt embedded development

I learnt C/C++, RTOS, and worked on embedded systems using [mBed OS](https://os.mbed.com/mbed-os/). Working with communication protocols like ModBus, Bluetooth and WiFi. In the mean time I also learnt a bit of machine learning using Python, Jupyter and Tableau. And doubled as a scrum master for a year.

##### After 3 years in embedded, I was posted to work on a full stack project

Getting my hands into [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), TypeScript, ReactJs, ExpressJs and even some Unity. Tasked with UI/UX as well, I picked up [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and [ExcaliDraw](https://excalidraw.com/) for ideation and planning. And for the rest of the stack, I skimmed off the top of Redis, Docker, Azure, Kubernetes and Keycloak.

##### On the side, through the years

I also took on courses with providers like [GovTech Digital Academy](https://www.thedigitalacademy.tech.gov.sg/), [Secure Code Warrior](https://www.securecodewarrior.com/), [NUS-ISS](https://www.iss.nus.edu.sg/), [NTU ACE](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/business/ugadmission/undergraduate-programmes/nbs-academy-for-career-excellence) and [SANS Institute](https://www.sans.org/). With them, I learnt more in depth on things like OOP (using Java), System Architecting, Agile Project Management using Scrum and Web App Penetration Testing.

##### When I end my day

I enjoy playing video games, board games, reading, and occasionally, exploring the real world. Occasionally, I also come back to this site and fill it with things I've learnt in the wild wild web.
