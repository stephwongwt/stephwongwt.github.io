I'm always excited to learn about new technologies and gadgets, which has led me to explore a variety of roles and skills over the years.

##### My Journey

I began my career as a multimedia developer, working with tools like ActionScript, Adobe Creative Suite, and web technologies such as PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

##### A Career Shift

I later made the switch to embedded systems, where I learned C/C++ and RTOS. I also worked with communication protocols like ModBus, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi.

##### Full-Stack Adventures

My next project was in full-stack development, where I created a dashboard using Next.js, TypeScript, React, ExpressJs and Unity. Working with technologies like Redis, Docker, Azure, Kubernetes, and Keycloak.

##### Always Learning

In addition to hands-on work, Iâ€™ve taken courses in areas like object-oriented programming, system architecture, agile project management, and web app security through places like GovTech, NUS-ISS, and the SANS Institute.

##### Outside of Work

When I'm not coding, I also enjoy playing video games, board games, reading, and exploring new countries and cultures.
