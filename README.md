I will be using this site to keep a blog of all the things I've learnt on the way, or whatever I have found interesting!

## Start local development

Use `bundle exec jekyll serve --force_polling --livereload` to start with live reload.

## Credits

This site was created based on [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) jekyll theme!
