I then used Processing to program the board to collect data, together with a Bluetooth module to send out data packets to a paired mobile device which will then transmit data via GPRS to a server which serves a web dashboard so that caregivers can monitor the condition of a patient. After using breadboards to create proof-of-concepts, I soldered them together to create a working prototype which was used in our project exhibitions.<br /><br />Afterwards, I worked on a project for to create a real time logistics web tracker, I helped to develop some of the web interface using HTML, CSS, jQuery and MySQL. During that time we used AJAX and Web Sockets to achieve real time updates on the dashbaord.<br /><br />Another project I was involved in was to create a virtual campus tour created using Unity. I oversaw creating the 3D environment in Unity, importing BIM data and applied matching textures to those models. The application was then paired with an Xbox Kinect camera to allow the user to interact and navigate within the virtual campus","highlights":[]},{"name":"The Garden Slug LLP, Singapore","position":"Service Agent","url":"","startDate":"2013-07-01","endDate":"2014-08-01","summary":"During this period, I took a chance to try out a different career path in the service line.

Together with two experienced UI/UX designers, we brainstormed for UI/UX ideas, creating iterations of designs before we started creating the applications. In the end, this team of 4 took 10 months to research and fully develop the two mobile applications and overhauled the website.","highlights":[]},{"name":"Ministry of Defence, Singapore","position":"Web Administrator","url":"https://www.mindef.gov.sg/","startDate":"2017-05-01","endDate":"2019-05-01","summary":"My main responsibility was to manage MINDEFâ€™s websites and its various sub-sites, ensuring that authorized content are timely uploaded.
